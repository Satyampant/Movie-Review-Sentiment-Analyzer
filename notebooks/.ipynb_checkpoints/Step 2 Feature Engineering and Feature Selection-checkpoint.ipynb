If you think you've seen everything, you haven't---I can't recall a movie where my jaw was open half the time, not believing what I was seeing---but it was all in fun. David Hasselhoff's performance was a spot-on parody of himself, and he did it with aplomb---laughed out loud several times during his scenes.

She points out a problem in a beloved industry not to assign blame or to complain, but because she is aware that most of this is done unintentionally yet, when you sum it all up, has dire consequences in the real world. I feel like the people giving bad reviews haven't watched the videos, at least not fully watched them, or are of bad faith. Sarkeesian literally says in her videos that game designers aren't evil guys twirling their mustaches while part of some conspiracy, they just probably aren't aware of what they're doing or the impact of their choices on society's view of women and violence against them.

Nonetheless, I find that Jacks's moving and often emotional character arc is nothing short of a modern literary masterpiece that will be worshiped alongside other pinnacles of human achievement. Like Sisyphus I am tormented on a daily basis knowing that I will never produce anything that shall rival or even pay homage to Dorbees: Making Decisions and that all else is meaningless.

I loved it; I thought it was a very advanced thoughtful film. The graphic were #killer. The comparison of video game culture and young girl culture was spot on. This film makes connections that I've never seen on the big screen but, do see in every day life.The casting was spot on, Hello 12 year-old girls are supposed to be a little annoying. I do wish that more directors would take color into more consideration the way this film does. T The highly stylized sets make the murder scenes more believable because everything is so unbelievable. How can you live in 2016 and not \"get\"a film about social media and accelerationism. #duh Someone explain this to me.   \n",
       "120334  I don't understand the negative reviews for this movie.This deserve a 10 stars.Something is definitely wrong with people when they do not care for a positive message in a movie.This movie was beyond great,had a touch of everything.It shows what can happen when a person's influence can change lives.These young boys had no hope,they could not see a promising future.The streets are what they knew,and of course,some of you can't relate, but if you are a fair person,then you will try to understand it from that viewpoint.I was not raised in a bad neighborhood,nor the streets, and i still totally get this movie.Life is about sacrifices and there were many a lessons in this movie that are based on real life for so many young people out there.This is their reality, and however fate made an entrance in these young boys life.It brought them someone that made them believe in themselves.

The only reason this movie got bad reviews is because it is a horrible movie. However if you want to go just to laugh, you should definitely see it. In my opinion, it is one of the funniest ones so far.No Scary Movie movies are supposed to be good movies, they're supposed to be funny movies. That's the point, they are made to be that way. Critics should know that. It's a 0.5/10 for a good movie but 9/10 for the funny parts. Don't listen to the critics they don't know what they're talking about . Movies I recommend you see before just watching it: -Paranormal Activity 4 -Black Swan -Cabin In The Woods -Planet of the Apes -Evil Dead   \n",
       "120550  I was a fan of the first one, but hesitant to watch this entry, as there are sooooooo many bad reviews out there. Well, I was more than pleasantly surprised. First, for those upset with the sex, um, the title pretty much clues you in. This is total camp, with lots of intentional humor, as well as lots of gore, sex, and pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. If you think you've seen everything, you haven't---I can't recall a movie where my jaw was open half the time, not believing what I was seeing---but it was all in fun. David Hasselhoff's performance was a spot-on parody of himself, and he did it with aplomb---laughed out loud several times during his scenes. And actually, I laughed out loud during this movie more than I did during the two \"Hangover\" movies (which I enjoyed)put together--- and the laughs were in the right spots, for all the right reasons. There were also some very well-executed tension and scare scenes that I was very impressed by. The effects to me were ve...   \n",

       "135402  I have to disagree with all of the other commenters. I have currently watched the 3 videos about the \"Damsel in Distress\" trope and found them extremely well done. Sarkeesian does not blame anyone: not gamers, not designers,not \"men\",... She also does not portray gamers as evil women-hating misogynists. She points out a problem in a beloved industry not to assign blame or to complain, but because she is aware that most of this is done unintentionally yet, when you sum it all up, has dire consequences in the real world. I feel like the people giving bad reviews haven't watched the videos, at least not fully watched them, or are of bad faith. Sarkeesian literally says in her videos that game designers aren't evil guys twirling their mustaches while part of some conspiracy, they just probably aren't aware of what they're doing or the impact of their choices on society's view of women and violence against them. She even points out how the tropes are harmful for males as well as females...   \n",

I watched it the other day and found it to be thought provoking and very profound. There were some production problems, I guess for its low budget, but all in all, I really liked this movie. I specially loved the music. I can't wait to see what the director comes up with next. You can tell he has a lot of talent and originality. Making reference to the gay holocaust is something that I found to be refreshing and have not seen in any other film since \"Bent\" which I loved. The moving back and forth within time periods was effective. The actors did a descent job. I'd like to see more work from Craig Pinkston. I read all of the bad reviews on this site. I think most here are too focused on the production values of the film rather than the message.   \n",

       "135831  I've seen and read some of the bad reviews of this animated short. They are fundamentally flawed as they fail to acknowledge Dorbees artistic merits and groundbreaking art style. It truly is Pollock to Hopper's Toy Story, which at the time some struggled to accommodate widespread recognition. Dorbees esoteric nature is perhaps responsible for its mediocre to shoddy rating. Nonetheless, I find that Jacks's moving and often emotional character arc is nothing short of a modern literary masterpiece that will be worshiped alongside other pinnacles of human achievement. Like Sisyphus I am tormented on a daily basis knowing that I will never produce anything that shall rival or even pay homage to Dorbees: Making Decisions and that all else is meaningless. Like the mythical Chimera, Dorbees must be respected for its hybrid nature. It should be recognised for its musical, artistic, dramatic, and satirical elements which unlike the Chimera are certainly not fictitious. I suspect the digital ...   \n",
